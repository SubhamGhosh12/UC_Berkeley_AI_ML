### Project Title : Machine Learning Approach to Identify Risk Factors of Mortality in US Population

**Author** : Subham Ghosh

#### Executive summary

#### Rationale
 Understanding and identifying risk-factors and sub-groups of the population that are at increased risk for mortality is important for increasing average life expectancy, a key metric in human development index. It is also important from the perspective of instituting socio-economic and/or healthcare policies for population at risk,  targeting better managed healthcare as well as social support for these groups to potentially extend their lives. Large national studies of mortality are relatively rare. Based on some of the studies that have been done,  mortality has been linked to different socio-economic factors as well as factors related to gender, ethnicity, race, geography, availability and access to quality healthcare. However, the relative importance of these different factors on mortality is not well understood.
 
#### Research Question
The key objective of this project is to build machine learning models for predicting mortality and identifying the top risk factors associated with mortality in a nation-wide sample of US population.

#### Data Sources
The National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS) is a national, longitudinal, mortality study sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the National Cancer Institute, the Health Statistics part of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Census Bureau for the purpose of studying the effect of differentials in demographic and socio-economic characteristics on mortality. 

The data includes a series of cross-sectional, national samples of the U.S. population, as identified from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC â€“ formerly the Current Population Survey) of the Bureau of the Census. The latest release of NLMS, version 5,  includes data files for public use from a survey with full follow-up for 11 years (n=1,835,072). Records from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC), beginning in March 1979 were matched to the National Death Index to identify the occurrence and cause of death through 2011. Extensive demographic, social, economic, and occupation information is collected in the ASEC. The linkage of the individual social and economic data with the mortality outcomes provides the resource for extensive analysis.
